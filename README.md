duke-libraries.github.io
========================

Pages for development projects of Duke University Libraries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisite(s)
These are the technologies you'll need in order to run Jekyll
1. Ruby
2. Bundler

 `gem install bundler`

Now that we have those in place, let's set up the blogging environment.

### First...
Clone our repository:
`git clone git@github.com:duke-libraries/duke-libraries.github.io.git`

### Second...
For relatively easy blogging in a local development environment, set up Jekyll, [using these instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).

```
gem install jekyll
cd <into-your-cloned-directory>
jekyll serve
```
